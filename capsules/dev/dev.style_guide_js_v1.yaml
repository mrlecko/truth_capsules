title: JS/TS Style Guide (Practical Defaults)
statement: |-
  Keep the surface consistent; let tools fight bikeshedding.

  Formatter & Lint
    • Prettier; ESLint with recommended + security (eslint-plugin-security) + import/order.
    • TypeScript strict for libraries; app code minimally typed but typed at boundaries.

  Testing & UI
    • Jest/Vitest + Testing Library; prefer role-based queries; avoid brittle snapshots.
    • Keep components pure; derive state; lift state when two consumers need it.

  Examples
    • API calls have abort controllers and sane timeouts.
    • Avoid implicit any; prefer union types to magic strings.
