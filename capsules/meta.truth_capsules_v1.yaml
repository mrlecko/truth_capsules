  TRUTH CAPSULES (v1): What they are, why they matter, and how to use them.
  WHAT —Truth Capsules are small, signed YAML knowledge objects that bundle:
    • A clear normative STATEMENT (human-readable rule, method, or explainer) 
  • PEDAGOGY (Socratic prompts + aphorisms for fast onboarding)  • Optional WITNESSES
  (executable checks that emit machine-readable JSON and GREEN/RED outcomes)They
  are designed to be “projection-friendly”: profiles decide which fields to render
  (usually just `title` + `statement`), while witnesses provide proof-carrying automation
  for CI, codereview, or ops.— WHY (Proof-carrying knowledge) —  1) Reproducibility:
  capsules can include runnable checks; outputs are JSON with crisp GREEN/RED.
    2) Composability: bundles group capsules into kits (e.g., CI gates, MacGyver
  pedagogy, Code Assistant).  3) Safety: witnesses run in locked-down sandboxes;
  provenance+signing provide audit trails.  4) Projection discipline: a profile
  creates consistent system prompts from the same source of truth.  5) Career/Org
  leverage: “show, don’t tell” — every claim can ship with a verifiable witness.
    — HOW (Views, Bundles, Witnesses) —  • Profiles (view): define which capsule
  fields are projected (e.g., title+statement) and output style (e.g., “fail fast
  on RED”).  • Bundles (kit): ordered lists of capsules for a task/context (e.g.,
  ci_quality_gates_v1).  • Capsules: information-only (explainer/guidance) or
  witnessed (proof-carrying).    – Information-only: pedagogy-forward explainers
  for onboarding and conversation quality.    – Witnessed: executable checks (python/node/bash)
  with `code: |-` blocks and explicit `env` mappings.  • Execution model: a runner
  loads capsule YAML, extracts each witness, executes in a constrained environment,
  captures `{ok: bool, ...}` JSON, and returns exit code 0 (GREEN) or 1 (RED/error).
  CI treats any RED as a failing gate.— SCHEMA V1 (essentials) —  Required:
  `id`, `version`, `domain`, `statement`.  Recommended: `title`, `pedagogy`, `provenance`,
  `applies_to`, `security`.  Witnesses use inline code and should specify: `name`,
  `language`, `entrypoint`, `env` (mapping), `timeout_ms`, and `fs_mode`.  All
  human-visible guidance should live in `statement` so profiles can project a single
  coherent explainer.— SECURITY & OPERATIONAL NOTES —  • Run witnesses in
  containers (non-root, no network, read-only FS unless explicitly required).
    • Use minimal `env:` allowlists; record provenance, review status, and signing
  metadata.  • Prefer deterministic fixtures for demo reliability; keep failure
  modes crisp and legible.— QUICKSTART (mental model) —  1) Choose a profile
  (view): e.g., conversational explainer vs CI gate reporter.  2) Load a bundle
  (kit): the ordered set of capsules for your task.  3) Project → the profile
  renders title+statement for humans; optionally execute witnesses for proofs.
    4) Read the JSON evidence; GREEN/RED is the contract.— THIS GOLDEN EXPLAINER
  —  This capsule is the “rootmost” documentary explainer for the v1 demo. It’s
  informational (pedagogy-heavy) and ships with a tiny, self-contained witness that
  demonstrates canonicalization and hashing of “core content” (the proof-carrying
  ethos) without requiring any external files. Use it to sanity-test your runner
  and to onboard readers to the Truth Capsules approach.
assumptions:
- Profiles will project `statement` (and optionally `title`) to build consistent,
  reproducible prompts.
- Witnesses execute in a minimal sandbox with explicit env allowlists and short timeouts.
- Readers value GREEN/RED + JSON evidence over prose alone.
pedagogy:
- kind: Socratic
  text: What decision becomes safer or faster if it ships with a GREEN/RED witness
    instead of prose claims?
- kind: Socratic
  text: Which part of our process needs an explainer (info) versus a gate (witnessed)?
- kind: Socratic
  text: If this statement were wrong, what short witness would falsify it?
- kind: Socratic
  text: What minimal JSON evidence would convince a skeptical reviewer?
- kind: Socratic
  text: Which fields should your profile project so prompts stay stable across tools?
- kind: Aphorism
  text: No witness, no claim.
- kind: Aphorism
  text: Project once, reuse everywhere.
- kind: Aphorism
  text: Small gates, big safety.
- kind: Aphorism
  text: Prose persuades; proofs endure.
- kind: Aphorism
  text: One JSON beats ten opinions.
