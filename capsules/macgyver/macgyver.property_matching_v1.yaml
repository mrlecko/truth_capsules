title: Property-to-Law Matching
statement: Map constraints to physical laws (pressure, torque, optics, buoyancy, friction)
  and then to available properties and parts.
assumptions:
- Basic physics are more portable than specific tools.
pedagogy:
- kind: Socratic
  text: Which law satisfies the need with the fewest steps?
- kind: Socratic
  text: What property‑set makes that law easy to apply here?
- kind: Aphorism
  text: Name the energy, not the object.
