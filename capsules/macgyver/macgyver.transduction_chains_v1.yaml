title: Transduction Chains
statement: 'Route one energy into the effect you need: chemical→thermal→mechanical,
  optical→thermal, electrical→magnetic, pneumatic/hydraulic→force.'
assumptions:
- Safer energy conversions exist than direct brute force.
pedagogy:
- kind: Socratic
  text: Which energy form is easiest to start from in your scene?
- kind: Socratic
  text: What two-stage conversion achieves the effect with lower risk?
- kind: Aphorism
  text: Route energy; don’t brute energy.
- kind: Aphorism
  text: Two cheap stages outrun one clever stage.
