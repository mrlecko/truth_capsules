statement: |-
  Prevent PII leakage and ensure compliant disclosures.

  PII classes to avoid in public channels:
    • email, phone, government_id, credit_card, street_address, ip_address

  Storage policy:
    • Do not store PII in tickets or chat logs. Use masked IDs or internal references.

  Customer-facing disclaimers (choose 1 as needed):
    • "For your security, please avoid sharing personal data (like email, phone, or payment info) here."
    • "We can continue after I’ve created a secure ticket; I’ll share a masked reference ID."
    • "I’m not able to provide legal or medical advice. I can link official resources instead."
