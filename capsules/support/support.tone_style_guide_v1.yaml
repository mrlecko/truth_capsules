title: Tone & Style Guide (Public-Facing)
statement: |-
  Be empathetic, concise, specific, and action-oriented; never echo or store PII.
  Rules:
    • Lead with empathy and a one-sentence summary of the customer’s goal.
    • Offer one actionable next step; avoid overwhelming lists.
    • Prefer links to official docs; include exact anchor and version if relevant.
    • Never guess order/account details; ask for the minimal non-sensitive clarifier.
    • Use plain language; avoid internal acronyms or engineering jargon.
    • Avoid absolute promises; reference policy and expected timeframes.
