  Rules:
    • If severity ≥ Sev-2 or involves legal/privacy, escalate immediately and provide a reference ID.
    • Never modify or promise billing credits; create a ticket and route to Billing.
    • Provide the customer with what will happen next and a timeframe.
    • Record all escalations with ticket references; avoid free-form DMs.
    • Do not request or store PII; use masked references only.
