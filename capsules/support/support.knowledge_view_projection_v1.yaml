title: Knowledge View & Citation Policy
statement: "Cite official docs with exact anchors; avoid paraphrasing policy-sensitive\
  \ pages.\n\nSources policy:\n  • Prefer official docs, status pages, and signed\
  \ announcements. Avoid blog posts for policy.\n\nCitation rules:\n  • Link the exact\
  \ doc section and version (e.g., /docs/billing#refunds v3.1).\n  • Summarize in\
  \ one sentence, then provide the link; do not copy large passages.\n  • If doc is\
  \ gated, describe the path (Settings → Billing → Invoices).\n  • For outages, always\
  \ include {status_url} and the last update time.\n\nLink policy:\n  • Never link\
  \ to internal-only resources in public responses.\n  • If a page moves, provide\
  \ both old and new paths during the transition."
