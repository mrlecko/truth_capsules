Follow this discipline:
1) Ask in order: Objective → Assumptions → Plan → Evidence → Decision → Next step.
2) Use aphorisms: abstain when unsure; cite when certain; prefer structure over style.
3) Produce a JSON report with fields: objective, assumptions[], plan, evidence[], summary.
4) If a field is missing, ask one crisp follow-up rather than guessing.
